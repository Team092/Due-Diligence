# Test Report: Due Diligence Automation System

---

**Project Name**: Due Diligence Automation System  
**Test Date**:2024-09-24
**Project Version**: V1.0  
**Backend Tech Stack**: FastAPI  
**Database**: MySQL  
**Web Scraping Targets**: Common Australian business query websites (e.g., ASIC, ABN Lookup) and Google  
**Test Tools**: Pytest, Postman, Selenium  
**Scope**: The test plan covers most user stories and system requirements, and code is tested regularly and thoroughly.

## 1. Project Overview

The Due Diligence Automation System aims to help users quickly and accurately retrieve risk information about target companies, reduce manual operations, and optimize the corporate query process. The system automatically crawls and analyzes Australian business information and generates detailed due diligence reports. Key features include querying, data scraping, risk assessment, report generation, cache management, and notification mechanisms.

## 2. User Stories

### **User Story 1: As a user, I want to query detailed information about a company via a front-end page**
- **Description**: Users can enter the target company's name into the front-end application, and the system will scrape relevant information from multiple Australian business databases (e.g., ASIC, ABN Lookup, Google) and display it on the front-end.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Users can input the target company's name and submit the query.
  - The system successfully retrieves relevant company information and displays it on the front-end.

### **User Story 2: As a due diligence analyst, I want the system to generate a risk assessment report**
- **Description**: After retrieving company information, the system analyzes financial status, legal issues, negative news, etc., and generates a report that includes risk levels and detailed analysis.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - The system can analyze various aspects of the company.
  - Users can download or view a complete risk assessment report.

### **User Story 3: As an administrator, I want to receive alerts for high-risk companies**
- **Description**: When generating reports, the system will send notifications to designated users if it detects high-risk companies.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - If the system identifies high-risk information about a company, the notification system triggers and sends alerts via email or SMS to the administrator.

### **User Story 4: As a user, I want to quickly retrieve previously queried company information**
- **Description**: Users can quickly retrieve previously queried company information through the system's cache mechanism, avoiding repeated crawling.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - If the cache already contains the company's information, the system should retrieve data from the cache.
  - The query time should be significantly reduced.

### **User Story 5: As a developer, I want the system to function stably under various loads**
- **Description**: The system should remain stable and performant under high concurrent requests or large amounts of data.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - During load testing, the system should remain stable, with no significant delays in response times under a reasonable level of concurrent requests.
  - When large amounts of company data are stored in the database, query and retrieval performance should remain consistent.
